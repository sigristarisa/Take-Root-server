# 🍅🥬🍆 Take Root 🌽🫐🥕
## The first online garden planner, combining the square-foot method and the companion method

### Backstory
It’s been buzzwords in the gardening world: the square-foot garden & companion planting. Effective and sufficient, I gave it a go to try these methods out as a gardening newbie, without realizing how simple methods could lead to a complex planning.
Can't plant tomatos next to corns, but compliments carrots, which can harm potatos...? Mint is overpowering so you can't plant multiple seedlings? What would happen if I plant parsley next to it?

That is: gardeners have knowledge, lists, memos and techniques, but not the practical tool to plan their perfect garden!

In order to make gardening not only effective and sufficient BUT ALSO easy and simple, Take Root was created.

### What is "Square-Foot Method"?
**Square-foot gardening** (SFG) is a type of raised bed gardening — basically, a raised box divided into squares. With the square-foot gardening method, you plant in blocks instead of traditional rows. It’s a simple way to create easy-to-manage gardens with raised beds that need a minimum of time spent maintaining them. SFG advocates claim it produces more, uses less soil and water, and takes much less time to maintain than a traditional garden.

### And "Companion Method"?
**Companion planting** is when you grow certain fruits, herbs, vegetables and flowers side-by-side for beneficial effects, such as managing pests, promoting pollination, influencing soil nutrients and maintaining diversity.It also occurs naturally in nature, where certain plants grow together while others are never seen in each other's company.
